Blosxom Plug-in: iconset

=head1 DESCRIPTION

IconSet allows you to set an icon to be used within a particular story.  Set the $logos_url to the url for your icons.  You then use the <!-- iconset ### --> directive within a story to set an icon to be displayed for that story.  If a default icon is set by the icons plug-in, it will be overridden.

If the icons plugin is present, then you may continue to use the $icons::icons variable.  Otherwise, you can use the $iconset::iconset variable.

The $icon_file allows you to set an icon for any story in a category by using a definitions file.  This allows you to set an icon for any category, whether it is top level or not, without having a world readable datadir.  (The original icons plugin cannot do this.)

The format for iconfile is:
path=iconfile

and uses regexp's for either expression. So, 
/computers/blosxom=blosxom.gif will set the icon to blosxom.gif for any file in the computers/blosxom directory, or any of its subdirectories.

If you later defined:
/computers/blosxom/newstuff=cool.png, then anything in this one subdirectory will have a different icon.  The line that matches last is the one that "sticks."

By using this technique, you can replace the icons plugin altogether by replacing $iconset::iconset in your templates wherever you used to use $icons::icons.  If you do this, then change the $use_icons_plugin variable.
