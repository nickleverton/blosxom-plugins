=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: zlocaldepth

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin restricts entries to those within the $zlocaldepth::localdepth variable, which works just like blosxom's $depth variable.  Except that it is always calculated relative to the current directory.  This is useful, because unlike the built-in depth variable, it can be appropriately set from a config file via the config plugin to easily allow different depths in different parts of your site.


BTW, the name starts with a z so that it will follow other plugins that affect 
filters and abide by their settings.
