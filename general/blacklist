# 192.168.1.102 - block this ip addy
# 192.168.1.* - block the whole subnet
# 192.* - blocks a whole bunch of addresses
# .* - blocks the world
# 192.168.1 - fails to match, as this is not a complete address

# What should I display for a page that isn't found
$message = "404 Not Found\n";

=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: blacklist

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Allows you to blacklist (or whitelist) certain IP addresses or IP ranges by using regexp's.  You create two files, consisting of one term per line.  The plugin compares the visitor's IP address to each term and quits when it finds a match.  Whitelists supercede blacklists.

This plugin does not prevent blosxom from performing all of its steps.  Instead, if a visitor is blacklisted, it erases all of the HTML just prior to sending it to the visitor's browser, and instead sends a 404 code, making it appear as if your web pages are no longer present.
