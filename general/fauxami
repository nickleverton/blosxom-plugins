=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: fauxami

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Populates $fauxami::name with the "name" of the person
posting the weblog entry, using anything before a specified delimiter
( the default is . ) as the "name."  So, jack.story1.txt would yield
a $fauxami::name of jack and jill.story2.txt would yield a $fauxami::name
of jill.

You can optionally provide a $default_name, used when no faux name is
specified.

=head1 VERSION
