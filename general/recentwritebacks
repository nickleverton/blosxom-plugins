=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: recentwritebacks

=head1 DESCRIPTION

RecentWritebacks locates stories with comments posted within a specified period of time. If you are like me, you find it hard to keep up with comments posted to older articles.  This plugin is designed to assist with that.  You can also use it to make it easier for visitors to your site to locate the "Hot Topics" where writebacks are being submitted.

To use it, simply install the plugin and configure the $writebacks_extension and $writebacksdir variables.  They should match whatever you used in the writebacks plugin.

You can then use a url similar to:
	http://some.host/weblog/index.html?recent=5
to locate posts with comments written in the last 5 days.  You can also create links on your site to make this easier for your visitors.

You are also welcome to change the $switch_word variable to whatever you like to fit your site.
