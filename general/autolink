=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: autolink

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Allows you to create a list of keywords that are automatically converted to a url whenever they are used in a story.  You can insert "<!-- noautolink -->" in a story to prevent any changes

You can set your own location for the autolinks data file, but by default it lives in your data directory.
