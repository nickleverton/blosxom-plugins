=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: lucene

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Based upon: http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/08/13/luceneSearchFromBlosxom.html

Purpose: Lucene [http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/] is a fabulous
text search engine written in Java.  This plug-in hooks in the results
of a Lucene search, displaying only the stories matching the search query
(as specified by ?q=keywords).

Populates $lucene::search with "Search results for: keywords" for use in
flavour templates.

Replaces the default $blosxom::entries subroutine.  You'd best put it before
any other plug-ins that override the default $blosxom::entries subroutine.  
When ?q=keywords turns on the lucene plug-in, it'll then be used instead of
whatever other entries overrides you have down the chain.  

E.g. My setup is as follows:

01lucene

02entries_index

other

plugins

follow

This plug-in could be used as a template for hooking into just about any
files-based text search engine.
