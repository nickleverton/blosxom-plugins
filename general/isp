=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: isp

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This plug-in is designed for the ISP looking to provide Blosxom weblogs to all of its users.

It traps URLs of the form /~username/weblog (as defined by $url_match), setting
$blosxom::datadir to an appropriate directory (as defined by $user_datadir) in
"username"'s home directory.

=head2 Usage

Be sure this plug-in sits BEFORE all other plug-ins.  To force this, rename it 
to 00isp.
 
This plugin works in concert with the "config" plug-in, without which it
won't allow individual users to override the global Blosxom configuration by
placing config files in their $datadir.

Aside from this simple renaming, about all that should be needed is to 
ScriptAlias /~username/weblog to /cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi, replacing the paths as 
appropriate to your particular setup, of course.

=head2 Warning

Be sure to choose a $user_datadir _outside_ of the user's personal 
Web-accessible document-root.  In other words, don't use a $user_datadir of
/home/$username/www/weblog or the like, where anything under /home/$username/www
is world-readable.

=head2 Limitations

This plug-in doesn't allow for users to add their own plug-ins to their own plugin directories.  There's a race condition in this I've not yet worked my way around, but I have it in mind.

=head1 VERSION

2.0b3

Version number coincides with the version of Blosxom with which the 
current version was first bundled.
