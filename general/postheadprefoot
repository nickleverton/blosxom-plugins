=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: postheadprefoot

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Appends the contents of any posthead.flavour (specific to a particular flavour) 
or posthead (general, regardless of flavour) file found along a particular 
category path/directory to the head.flavour.

Prepends the contents of any prefoot.flavour (specific to a particular flavour) 
or prefoot (general, regardless of flavour) file found along a particular 
category path/directory to the foot.flavour.

In both cases, the plug-in prefers the posthead or prefoot  found closest to 
the point of the path at hand.  Also, preference is given to the flavour
specific versus general version.

=head1 VERSION
