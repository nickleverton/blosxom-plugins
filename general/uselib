=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: uselib 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Get modules from $blosxom::plugin_dir/lib

=head1 VERSION

0.0.1

=head1 AUTHOR

Mark Ivey <zovirl@zovirl.com>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Tells perl to look for perl modules in $blosxom::plugin_dir/lib.  This
gives users a standard place to install modules such as MIME::Types or 
File::Cat.  For example, Cat.pm would be installed to 
$blosxom::plugin_dir/lib/File.

Obviously, this plugin should be loaded before any plugins that need 
modules.  I accomplished this by renaming it to 01uselib (00 is taken by 
seeerror).
