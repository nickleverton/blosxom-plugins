=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: google_sitesearch

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Provides Google Free SiteSearch [http://www.google.com/services/free.html]
for your weblog.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Drop the google_sitesearch plug-in into your plugins directory.

Use $google_sitesearch::searchbox anywhere in your flavour templates you wish.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The google_sitesearch plug-in assumes you've signed up for Google's Free
SiteSearch [http://www.google.com/services/free.html] for your site.

The plug-in will just work out of the box without any configuration.
That said, it's probably best to apply any configuration settings you
made when you signed up for Google SiteSearch in the Configurable
Variables section.

While $domains defaults to something intelligent -- your Blosxom $url
sans the http:// bit -- you might fill in whatever values appear in 
the domains field of the form Google created for you when you signed
up.

e.g. <INPUT type=hidden name=domains value="example">

Simply paste everything between the "" between the "" of $domains in the 
Configurable Variables section.

Also, Google Free SiteSearch allows you to customize the look-and-feel
of your results pages.  If you'd like, you can set $cof to the value
appearing in the cof field of the form Google created for you when
you signed up.

e.g.  <INPUT type=hidden name=cof VALUE="GIMP:#666666;T:#666666;ALC:#666666;L:http://www.example/images/example.gif;GFNT:#666666;LC:#666666;BGC:#dddddd;AH:center;VLC:#666666;GL:1;S:http://www.example/;GALT:#666666;AWFID:2498b45f59b093e3;">

Simply paste everything between the "" between the "" of $cof in the 
Configurable Variables section.

=head1 VERSION
