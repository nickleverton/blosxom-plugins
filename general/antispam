=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: antispam

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin converts any email addresses in your stories into ascii code.  It 
has no visible or functional effect, other than to change the html source code.  
So something like this:
	fletcher@hidden.domain

Looks like this:
&#102;&#108;&#101;&#116;&#99;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#64;&#97;&#108;&#117;&#109;&#110;&#105;&#46;&#100;&#117;&#107;&#101;&#46;&#101;&#100;&#117;

But when viewed with a web browser, it is translated back into the expected 
human readable string.  The idea is that some of the spambots can't read this.  
Though as this technique becomes more popular, I am sure that the spambots will 
catch on.  But it can't hurt, right?


I would like to figure out how to get this work with Writebacks as well to hide 
email address that are submitted, but haven't gotten around to it.  If someone 
wants to modify the code and let me know, I can distribute the modified version 
and give you credit.

Let me know of any bugs!!
