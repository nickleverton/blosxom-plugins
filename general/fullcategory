=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: fullcategory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Changes blosxom behavior so full category names are required (partial names
will no longer work)

=head1 VERSION

0.0.2

=head1 AUTHOR

Mark Ivey <zovirl@zovirl.com>, http://zovirl.com

=head1 DESCRIPTION

fullcategory fixes blosxom so only complete category names will work.
By default, blosxom will return results for partial category name matches.
For example, if "telephone" is a category, these would all return posts about
telephones:
http://example.com/telephone
http://example.com/telepho
http://example.com/tele

(If "television" was also a category, that last example would include
posts from both the television & telephone categories)
