Purpose and state of these plugins:

+ pathbasedtagging: 

  Only useful together with the tagging plugin. Adds the possibility to
  use URL paths like blosxom.cgi/tags/whatever instead of
  blosxom.cgi?tags=whatever to show only posts tagged with "whatever".

  Status: Works, but bugs have been reported.

+ xml_ping_generic: 

  Can "ping" arbitrary services. URLs and formats have to be configured,
  though.

  Status: Worked. Should still work. Haven't checked for a long time. ;-)

+ multcat:

  Allows the use of symbolic links in categories. Useful only on unixoid
  operating systems which support symbolic links. The tagging plugin is
  much more straight forward and also works on Windows platforms.

  Status: Works, but won't get further development. Succeeded by the
  tagging plugin, but it's still there for legacy reasons. May get
  bugfixes if necessary.

+ tagging: 

  Allows tagging of posts as used by Technorati and others. Is able to
  filter by tags. Offers a tagcloud either with font-size, colour or both.

  Status: Got a few bug reports, but seems quite popular and generally
  working. :-)

+ dept: 

  Shows a "From the ... department" line as on Slashdot. Cheap language
  recognition based on paths.

  Status: Small, probably not that many bugs. Language recognition could
  be more generic or more configurable.

+ date_rf822: 

  Offers variables with RFC822 compliant dates, e.g. for feeds.

  Status: Wild hack. Not sure, if it's really necessary.

+ acronyms: 

  Automatic marking of words as <acronym>s or <abbr>eviations inside
  postings.

  Status: Works fine, the core has been used also in other environments

+ comments_antispam: 

  Forked from the comment plugin. Offers the use of an external
  blacklist and a very cheap but though effective text based (Question +
  Answer) static captcha.

  Status: Has a few known bugs (traceback doesn't work anymore) and some
  probably useless legacy code in. Needs a revamp...
