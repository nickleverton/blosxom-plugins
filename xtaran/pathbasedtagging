### Documentation:
#
# This is a plugin for blosxom.
#
# Installation:
#
#  You should use plugin sorted by numbers with this plugin. Drop it
#  into your blosxoms plugin directory and prefix it with a quite low
#  two digit number (e.g. 02) which should be lower than the number of
#  plugins having an entries subroutine, e.g entries_index or
#  entries_cache. The tagging plugin itself should have a higher
#  number than those plugins. (I use 02pathbasedtagging,
#  05entries_index and 25tagging.)
#
#  If you want, change some of the configuration variables below.
#
# What it does:
#
#  In your blog, it handles any (virtual) directory named tag or tags
#  special and remaps the beginning of the URL and the tags coming
#  after that virtual directory in a way the tagging plugin can work
#  as usual.
#
# Configuration:
#
#  You can change the regular expression for matching the special
#  directory name. You may want to configure the tagging plugin to use
#  the blosxom_tags linking style.
#
# How to use it:
#
#  Instead of URLs like http://blog/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi?-tags=foo,bar
#  you now can use http://blog/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/tags/foo/bar
#
# Version History:
#
#  0.01:   Initial release, together with tagging 0.04

	# the filtering
        CGI::param(-name => '-tags', -value => $tags);
    }

    # Keep the default method of searching entries
    return undef;
